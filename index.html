            This page is dedicated to some of the men who have had a significant influence and impact on my life. 
            Without these men I would not be anything like the man I am today.
            I am extremely grateful to have met these amazing people and to have had them be a fundamental part of my life.

                I was lucky to have been able to spend 23 years with the man that was my father. He was born in 1962 to a family of 7, 
                comprised of 3 brothers and 4 sisters. He came from a background of poverty but didn't let that hinder him. He was
                an entrepeneur who started his own concrete business and moving company with his brothers, and becamse an LAUSD bus driver
                while making a side living off of snow cones. Through him I gained my sense of humor and my morality. Some of his favorite
                hobbies were traveling and camping. His favorite spot was in Big Bear, California, about an hours drive from where we live.
                He passed away in 2019, but the lessons he taught me will stay with me until my last breath.

            I first met Coach George in 2015 when one of my friends brought me to her gym class. He was a "tough love" kind of guy. I stopped going to
            his classes after a month, but as fate would have it that was not the last time I would see him. Years later I was required to take a college
            fitness class and it turned out he was part of the head of the fitness program. I learned the fundamentals of working out and what was the most
            efficient way of working out for my body. His tough love pushed me, along with other students, to become a better person not only physically but
            mentally as well. I am thankful for the tools that George gave me that have continued to benefit me and my health.

            I first met Matthew in a guitar class back in 7th grade, 2010. The class wasn't funded as well at the time so we were forced to
            share a guitar as the instructor gave his lessons, this is what would eventually bond us later that year. We didn't speak much, but after 2
            months into the semester he joined my English class and the teacher's seating chart forced us to sit together. This was the start of our now almost 
            12 year friendship. We bonded over the music that our parents had us listen to which was carried over into our guitar class, our sense of humors
            and our shared sense of morality. We've since went on many trips and adventures, growing our friend group along the way while pushing each other
            to be the best versions of ourselves we can be. I am thankful for the level of trust and comradery that we've grown to have for each other over the years.
